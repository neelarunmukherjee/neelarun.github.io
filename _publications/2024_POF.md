Abstract: A fundamental understanding of two-phase flow behavior in microfluidics is crucial for various technological applications across different
17 disciplines, including energy, chemical, and material engineering, as well as biomedical, environmental, and pharmaceutical sciences. In this
18 work, we elucidate the flow fields of low Capillary number [Ca] segmented Taylor flows of immiscible CO2 emulsions/bubbles
19 transported by water in a low aspect ratio microchannel. We conducted high-resolution two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) numerical
20 simulations using an improved volume-of-fluid two-phase flow solver and validated their accuracy against experimental data. Our results
21 show that 3D simulations are necessary to accurately capture the dynamics of liquid and supercritical CO2 emulsions produced at relatively
22 higher Ca. The 3D simulation results also reveal diverse patterns of spanwise vortices, which are overlooked in 2D simulations. Calculating
23 the Q-criterion in 3D revealed that vortices with relatively higher vorticity magnitudes are adjacent to the sidewalls, with the strongest ones
24 emerging across the microchannel in the third dimension. More specifically, gaseous CO2 bubbles display relatively intense vortex patterns
25 near the interfacial region of the bubble body and the cap due to the influence of the surrounding thin liquid film and slug flow. At higher
26 Ca, liquid and supercritical CO2 emulsions exhibit similar flow dynamics, however, with prominent vortex patterns occurring in the upstream
27 cap region. These findings pinpoint specific areas within the emulsions/bubbles that require attention to enhance stabilization or exchanging
28 mechanisms for low-Ca Taylor flow of emulsions/bubbles.
