I come from Kolkata, the capital city of West Bengal in India also known as a the <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/asia/india/articles/why-kolkata-is-the-city-of-joy-in-25-instagram-photos/" style="color: #5b4c5c;">City of Joy </a>.  I am a PhD candidate at  the <a href="https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/research/" style="color: #5b4c5c;"> Jackson School of Geosciences</a>, <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" style="color: #5b4c5c;">University of Texas at Austin</a>. My supervisor is <a href="https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/cardenas/" style="color: #5b4c5c;">  Prof. Bayani Cardenas</a>. I am working on Arctic Hydrogeology for my PhD dissertation. 

I completed my bachelors and masters in Exploration Geophysics from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" style="color: #5b4c5c;">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur </a> in India. 

My primary research interest lies in modeling transport and flows in the subsurface. How to address the growing drinking water crisis due to groundwater contamination around the world by developing robust models to explain transport phenomena in the subsurface, primarily in the vadose and the critical zones considering the effects of increasing human interference? How to overcome the hurdle to simulate the reactive transport of injected CO2 over long periods in saline aquifers considering the factors of interfacial tension, hysteric relative permeability, and dynamicchanges in salinity? These are some of the questions that motivate me to choose the field of computational hydrogeology as my primary research interest.
