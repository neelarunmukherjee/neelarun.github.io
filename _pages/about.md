I am originally from Kolkata, the capital city of West Bengal in India also known as a the <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/asia/india/articles/why-kolkata-is-the-city-of-joy-in-25-instagram-photos/" style="color: #5b4c5c;">City of Joy</a>. I am currently a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/research/" style="color: #5b4c5c;"> Jackson School of Geosciences</a>, <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" style="color: #5b4c5c;">University of Texas at Austin</a>. I am working with <a href="https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/cardenas/" style="color: #5b4c5c;">  Prof. Bayani Cardenas</a> on flow and transport processes within supra-permafrost aquifers in continuous permafrost watersheds. My primary research interest lies in understanding flow and reactive transport in the subsurface. My goal is to address the growing drinking water crisis due to groundwater contamination around the world by developing robust models to explain complex transport phenomena in the subsurface, primarily within the critical zone considering the effects of increasing human interference is one of my broad research interests. 

I am currently focused on the complex transport processes that take place in the thawing Arctic permafrost due to global warming and how they affect the overall water cycle in the Arctic region. Not only is this important for the water cycle, the Arctic permafrost stores a huge amount of greenhouse gases like CH4, CO2, NOx which will get released as the Earth warms up and thus, will affect the global climate. I am interested in understanding the complex subsurface transport physics taking place in the dynamic Arctic subsurface by field and computational experiments.

I completed my bachelors and masters (<a href="https://erp.iitkgp.ac.in/ERPWebServices/curricula/CurriculaSubjectsList.jsp?stuType=UG&splCode=EX" style="color: #5b4c5c;">Integrated BS-MS </a>) in Exploration Geophysics from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" style="color: #5b4c5c;">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur </a> in India.
