I am originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata" style="color: #5b4c5c;"> Kolkata</a>, the capital city of West Bengal in India also known as a the <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/asia/india/articles/why-kolkata-is-the-city-of-joy-in-25-instagram-photos/" style="color: #5b4c5c;">City of Joy</a>. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/research/" style="color: #5b4c5c;"> Jackson School of Geosciences</a>, <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/" style="color: #5b4c5c;">University of Texas at Austin</a>. I am working with <a href="https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/cardenas/" style="color: #5b4c5c;">  Prof. Bayani Cardenas</a> on flow and transport processes within supra-permafrost aquifers in continuous permafrost watersheds. 

My primary focus is unraveling the intricacies of flow and reactive transport in the subsurface. My research aims to contribute solutions to the escalating global drinking water crisis caused by groundwater contamination. To achieve this, I am committed to developing robust models that can effectively explain the complexities of transport phenomena in the subsurface, particularly within the critical zone. I am particularly intrigued by the challenges posed by increasing human interference in these processes. Currently, my research is honed in on the intricate transport dynamics unfolding in the thawing Arctic permafrost, driven by the effects of global warming. This exploration extends beyond the water cycle implications, delving into the substantial reservoir of greenhouse gases, such as CH4, CO2, and NOx, stored in the Arctic permafrost. As Earth warms, releasing these gases will significantly impact the global climate. My interest lies in comprehending the nuanced subsurface transport physics at play in the dynamic Arctic environment, employing a combination of field and computational experiments.

I completed my bachelors and masters (<a href="https://erp.iitkgp.ac.in/ERPWebServices/curricula/CurriculaSubjectsList.jsp?stuType=UG&splCode=EX" style="color: #5b4c5c;">Integrated BS-MS </a>) in Exploration Geophysics from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" style="color: #5b4c5c;">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur </a> in India.
